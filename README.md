## Packages
- [SpaDES](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/SpaDES) : Metapackage for implementing a variety of event-based models, with a focus on spatially explicit models. These include raster-based, event-based, and agent-based models.
- [simecol](http://simecol.r-forge.r-project.org/): "a lightweight R package that employs an object oriented paradigm for the implementation of dynamic simulation models."
- [NetLogoR](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/NetLogoR): "Easily create agent-based models in R following the NetLogo framework (Wilensky, 1999)."
